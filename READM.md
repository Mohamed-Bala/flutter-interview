# Flutter interview 

This interview is designed to test our entry level flutter and mobile app engineers. We want to smoothen away the challenges people face when they are interviewing by making the process very transparent and seamless. We want competent, reliable and trustworthy people. Engineers we can rely upon to build our company, so our values (at least from engineering point of view):

- be trustworthy
- never lie
- failures are imminent, let's understand them and try and learn from them
- communication is the key to our success; always try to assume the best interpretation and in case of doubt ask your peers
- we are building a team and we care a lot about our team members and the team morale
- always help and support each others; office politics won't be tolerated
- don't be an arse, don't be rude, don't attack or offend others; whether they were your colleagues or our customers


In short, we want to build a place where everyone feels they belong and they believe in what we are building.


## The task

The task is quite simple.  You will be given a Figma document (UI) and your task is to convert it to flutter code.

### Steps

Concretly, what we want is the following:


- Implement flutter code from the provided figma code
- Share with us a working demo (github repo)
- Share with us documentation about how to run your code. Build and run the code
- A document that describes your work, what you, why did you do them and so
- unit testing your code is plus, but it is okay for junior / intern roles
- Any notes, recommendations, etc anything you see worth mentioning is huge plus too.

*Please submit your code in a private repo.*

Thanks and good luck.
